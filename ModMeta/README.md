# Classic Items

## SUPPORT DISCLAIMER

### Use of a mod manager is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.

Seriously, use a mod manager.

If the versions of ClassicItems or TILER2 (or possibly any other mods) are different between your game and other players' in multiplayer, things WILL break. If TILER2 is causing kicks for "unspecified reason", it's likely due to a mod version mismatch. Ensure that all players in a server, including the host and/or dedicated server, are using the same mod versions before reporting a bug.

**While reporting a bug, make sure to post a console log** (`path/to/RoR2/BepInEx/LogOutput.log`) from a run of the game where the bug happened; this often provides important information about why the bug is happening. If the bug is multiplayer-only, please try to include logs from both server and client.

## Description

Adds some items from Risk of Rain 1 which RoR2 thought it was too good for.

For nostalgic purposes only. Here Be Dragons who hoard balance issues, because the numbers are closer to RoR1's than 2's... and, y'know, Brooch+Clover. Will absolutely lead to silly, broken runs, unless you feel like changing the config up -- most aspects of each item are configurable!

### Other Features

- Every item added by Classic Items can be individually disabled in the mod's config file.
- More config options for various aspects of item effects (how much regen a Mysterious Vial provides, which equipments Beating Embryo affects...).
- Most config options can be changed mid-run by using TILER2's AIC console commands.
- Descriptions in the logbook match config values.
- Some vanilla tweaks, also with config options:
    - Disables the H3AD5T V2 stomp move, which is normally triggered by holding jump in midair; this is replaced by the Headstompers item.
    - Converts most pickup models for base game items and equipment into trading cards (disabled by default).

## Issues/TODO

- More items are on the way! There's a lot to work with.
- Stats are set close to RoR1's whenever possible. May eventually set up a config preset which balances items a little more carefully with respect to RoR2's existing content.
- Beating Embryo has no effect on Lunar equipments (other than those added by mods). This is a design decision, but disabled-by-default effects are planned.
- Color tags on pickup model text are too bright.
- See the GitHub repo for more!

## Modder Resources

ClassicItems exposes some members as public for use in compatibility patches in other mods, including:

- Tools to implement Beating Embryo and Ancient Scepter behavior for other mods' equipment items and characters
