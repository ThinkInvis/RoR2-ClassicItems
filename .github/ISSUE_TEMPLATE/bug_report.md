### Describe the Bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

### Expected Behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

### Console Log
**Please include a link or embed of a FULL console log file from a run of the game where the bug happened**. This will provide a versioned mod list, and possibly other important information about the bug.

*To retrieve console logs:* A log from the most recent run of the game will be stored in `.../Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/LogOutput.log`. If using r2modman, go to Settings > Browse profile folder > `Profile Folder/BepInEx/LogOutput.log` instead.

*If the bug only happens in multiplayer:* try to provide console logs from both client and server.

*If the log file is too big to post:* this may be because of a once-per-frame error message. In this case, immediately close the game once the bug occurs to reduce log file size.
