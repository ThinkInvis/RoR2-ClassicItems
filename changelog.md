- All items can now be added to the AI blacklist from config. By default, this is enabled for: Life Savings, 56 Leaf Clover, Golden Gun, Rusty Jetpack, Smart Shopper, Photon Jetpack.
- Headstompers and Life Savings are now networked properly and should no longer act wonky if you're not the host.

- Several other small internal bugfixes and optimizations.

- ADDED ITEM: Golden Gun!
- Beating Embryo now works on Blast Shower and The Crowdfunder.
- Beating Embryo IL patches are now slightly more stable.
- Captain's Brooch is now networked and should animate smoothly and play sound for non-host players.
- Added a missing SubmoduleDependency which could cause Captain's Brooch to break if no other mod loaded the Submodule.
- Finished incomplete IL failure fallback for Captain's Brooch, which should no longer potentially cause errors if another mod interferes with its IL patch.
- Added inverse behavior at low stacks to Life Savings. Default config options now provide (per second, by stack count): $1/3, $1/2, $1, $2, $3....
- Updated libraries for RoR2 patch #4892828.

- Life Savings will now work if the ShareSuite mod is installed.
- Captain's Brooch should now display the correct cost to clients in multiplayer, and has much better ground targeting!
- Started using language tokens instead of direct string loading. May fix an unconfirmed issue with logbook entries resetting on mod uninstall; will definitely reset existing logbook entries for CI items, as their internal names have changed.
